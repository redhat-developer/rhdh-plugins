# Test Placement Advisor

Given the context of a change, bug, or new feature in the RHDH dynamic-plugin ecosystem, propose **where** it should be tested: which repository, which test layer, where the test lives, and how to create it. The guiding rule: **pick the cheapest environment that can actually catch the bug — most plugin validation does not need a cluster, and an increasing part doesn't need Docker either.**

## When to Use

- A developer asks "where should I test this?", "should this be an e2e test?", "does this need a cluster?", or "which repo does this test belong in?"
- A new plugin, plugin version bump, or plugin config change needs test coverage.
- A bug escaped to a cluster e2e run and the team wants a cheaper regression test.
- Reviewing a PR that adds a test at the wrong layer (e.g. a cluster e2e for pure UI logic).

## Step 1 — Gather context (ask if missing)

Before recommending, establish:

1. **What is being validated?** Plugin logic/UI component · packaging/published artifact · plugin loading/rendering inside RHDH · platform behavior (Helm/Operator/ingress/auth).
2. **Where did the change happen?** Plugin source (`rhdh-plugins` or another source repo) · packaging metadata (`rhdh-plugin-export-overlays`) · the RHDH app itself (`rhdh`).
3. **Does verifying it require a rendered UI?** (clicks, headings, navigation)
4. **Does it require real external services?** (GitHub, Keycloak, LDAP, managed DBs)
5. **Does it require cluster infrastructure?** (ConfigMap reload, routes, operator, pod logs, port-forward)

## Step 2 — Decision table

| The dev wants to verify… | Repo | Test type / harness | Cluster? | Docker? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin logic / components / API | `rhdh-plugins` (or the plugin's source repo) | unit + component tests, dev app (`yarn start`) | no | no |
| The plugin still builds as a dynamic plugin | `rhdh-plugins` | `export-dynamic` / `npx @red-hat-developer-hub/cli plugin export` | no | no |
| The **published OCI artifact** installs and the **backend plugin boots** | `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` | native smoke harness (`smoke-tests-native/`, overlays PR #2714) | no | **no** |
| All plugins of a workspace boot together | `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` | native smoke `--workspace` mode | no | **no** |
| A frontend artifact ships its bundle (`dist-scalprum/`, `plugin-manifest.json`) | `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` | native smoke presence check | no | **no** |
| The plugin **loads inside the real RHDH app** and the **UI renders** | `rhdh` | cluster-free E2E harness (`e2e:legacy-local`, rhdh PR #5005) | no | no |
| Every plugin in the **catalog index** is sane | `rhdh` | plugin sanity check (rhdh PR #4967, nightly) | no | no |
| RHDH **container** behavior (image entrypoint, install script inside the image) | any | Docker smoke / [rhdh-local](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local) | no | yes |
| Helm chart / Operator / ingress / real Keycloak / RBAC on OCP | `rhdh` e2e or `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` `workspaces/*/e2e-tests` | cluster e2e | **yes** | — |

Rule of thumb: **source bugs → rhdh-plugins · artifact bugs → overlays · integration/render bugs → rhdh · platform bugs → cluster e2e.** If a bug is catchable in more than one place, test it in the cheapest one and don't duplicate downstream.

## Step 3 — Layer ladder (cheapest that catches the bug wins)

| Layer | Scope | Tooling | Cluster | Typical time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** Unit | Pure functions / logic | Jest/Vitest | no | ms–s |
| **L2** Integration | Backend module + plugin API, mocked external deps | `startTestBackend` + supertest | no | s |
| **L3** Component | React component/page with a test harness | RTL + dev server | no | s–min |
| **L4a** E2E cluster-free | Full app, no managed infra | Playwright + local harness | no | min |
| **L4b** E2E full | Real OCP/K8s, managed DBs, real IdPs | Playwright + cluster | **yes** | min–h |

The full per-spec classification of the RHDH e2e suite lives in `rhdh/docs/e2e-tests/layer-migration-matrix.md` (RHIDP-15076) — consult it before adding or migrating an e2e spec.

## Step 4 — How to create the test (per placement)

### `rhdh-plugins` (or other source repo) — plugin correctness

- **Where:** `workspaces/<workspace>/plugins/<plugin>/src/**` next to the code, following that workspace's existing test setup (Jest/RTL; MSW for API mocks).
- **How:** copy the pattern of a neighboring `*.test.ts(x)`; run with the workspace's `yarn test`. Manual verification via the workspace dev app (`yarn start`).
- Also validate packaging when the plugin's build config changed: `npx @red-hat-developer-hub/cli plugin export` must produce `dist-dynamic/` (+ `dist-scalprum/` for frontend).
- **Cannot do here:** validate the *published* OCI artifact, or integration with RHDH's app shell/shared deps.

### `rhdh-plugin-export-overlays` — the published artifact

- **Where:** the native smoke harness (`smoke-tests-native/`, overlays PR #2714). Per-plugin: install from OCI with the real `install-dynamic-plugins` CLI and boot backend plugins via `startTestBackend`. Workspace mode: `yarn smoke --workspace <name>` boots every `oci://` artifact of the workspace together.
- New workspaces usually need **no new test code** — the harness discovers artifacts from `workspaces/<name>/metadata/*.yaml`.
- **Known gaps (don't fight them):** catalog-extending backend modules don't boot in a minimal `startTestBackend` (upstream `catalog-backend` registration issue — stay on Docker smoke until fixed); plugins whose `dynamicArtifact` is a local `./dynamic-plugins/dist/...` path ship inside the RHDH image and have no OCI artifact to validate here.
- **Never add UI-render tests here** — this repo has no app to render into. Delegate rendering to the `rhdh` cluster-free harness.
- `workspaces/*/e2e-tests` (cluster, Playwright + `e2e-test-utils`) exists for plugins whose value *is* cluster integration (topology, tekton, argocd…). Don't add one for UI-only behavior.

### `rhdh` — the real app

**L4a cluster-free harness** (`e2e-tests/playwright.legacy-local.config.ts`, docs at `docs/e2e-tests/local-e2e-harness.md`) — the only cheap place a frontend dynamic plugin can be *rendered*. To enable a spec/test:

1. Plugin not yet installed by the harness? Add its OCI entry to `e2e-tests/local-harness/dynamic-plugins.yaml` (tags on `ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/<package>`). If its mount-point config is not in the repo's static `app-config.dynamic-plugins.yaml`, attach the plugin's **canonical `pluginConfig`** (source of truth: `rhdh-plugins` → `workspaces/<ws>/plugins/<plugin>/app-config.dynamic.yaml`) — the harness loads the generated `dynamic-plugins-root/app-config.dynamic-plugins.yaml` last, exactly like the production container.
2. Config that only exists in CI config maps (`.ci/pipelines/resources/config_map/*`)? Mirror just the needed keys into `app-config.local-e2e.yaml` (objects deep-merge; arrays replace).
3. Tag the test `{ tag: "@cluster-free" }` and add its spec file to the config's `testMatch` allowlist.
4. Repopulate + validate: `./e2e-tests/local-harness/populate.sh`, then `yarn --cwd e2e-tests e2e:legacy-local` (CI does this in ~4 min; skopeo is Linux/CI-only).

**L4b cluster e2e** (`e2e-tests/playwright/e2e/**`) — only when the subject *is* cluster/platform behavior or a real external service. Requirements: `component` annotation in `beforeAll` (see `ci-e2e-testing` rule), correct config map choice (RBAC vs non-RBAC), project registration in `e2e-tests/playwright/projects.json` if a new project is needed.

**L3 component tests** — pattern established on branch `RHIDP-13235-layer3-component-tests` (page-level RTL compositions). Prefer this over L4a when no dynamic-plugin loading is involved.

**Catalog-index-wide sanity** (rhdh PR #4967, nightly) — nothing to write per plugin; it sweeps the whole index.

## Not possible today (researched — don't burn time)

- **Rendering a frontend dynamic plugin without an RHDH app** — the artifact is a legacy-frontend Scalprum bundle; no standalone host exists, and building one means maintaining a version-coupled "mini RHDH".
- **`@backstage/frontend-dynamic-feature-loader` for current plugins** — targets the new frontend system (alpha); our exported plugins are legacy-system bundles. Revisit when app-next matures (RHIDP-15082).
- **Catalog-extending modules in a minimal `startTestBackend`** — upstream `catalog-backend` issue (see overlays harness notes).

## Output format

Answer with a concrete recommendation:

- **Repo:** which of the three (or the plugin's own source repo).
- **Layer / harness:** L1–L4b + the specific harness or suite.
- **Location:** the directory/file where the test goes.
- **Scaffolding:** the minimal steps or files to create, referencing an existing neighbor as template.
- **Why not elsewhere:** one line on the layers you rejected (especially if the dev proposed a more expensive one).
- **Cost:** rough feedback time (seconds / ~4 min cluster-free / cluster job).
