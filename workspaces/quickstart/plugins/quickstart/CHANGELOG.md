### Patch Changes

- def4673: Fixes the issue where the quickstart drawer was reserving space for users with no eligible items

  - Centralize role determination at provider level to avoid re-fetching on drawer open/close
  - Add multi-layer protection to prevent empty drawer space when user has no eligible quickstart items
  - Remove complex caching logic from useQuickstartRole hook for cleaner implementation
  - Update components to use role from context instead of calling hook directly
  - Fix test mocks to work with new context-based architecture

  This resolves the issue where the quickstart drawer would open an empty space when the current user has no quickstart items configured for their role.
