# 📊 Scorecard Plugin for Backstage

The Scorecard plugin provides a configurable framework to visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Backstage. This frontend plugin integrates with the Scorecard backend to deliver Scorecards.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/scorecard](http://localhost:3000/scorecard).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.

## For Administrators

### Prerequisites

Before installing the frontend plugin, ensure that the Scorecard backend is integrated into your Backstage instance. Follow the [Scorecard backend plugin README](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/scorecard/plugins/scorecard-backend/README.md) for setup instructions.

### Installation

To install the Scorecard plugin, run the following command:

```sh
yarn workspace app add @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-scorecard
```

**Note**

### Permission Framework Support

The Scorecard plugin has support for the permission framework.

- When [RBAC permission](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/rbac/plugins/rbac-backend#installation) framework is enabled, for non-admin users to access scorecard UI, the role associated with your user should have the following permission policies associated with it. Add the following in your permission policies configuration file named `rbac-policy.csv`:

```CSV
p, role:default/team_a, scorecard.metric.read, read, allow

g, user:default/<your-user-name>, role:default/team_a
```

You can specify the path to this configuration file in your application configuration:

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    policies-csv-file: /some/path/rbac-policy.csv
    policyFileReload: true
```

### Configuration

1. Add the Scorecard page to you Entity overview page by modifying `packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import { ScorecardPage } from '@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-scorecard';

   const scorecardRoute = (
     <EntityLayout.Route path="/scorecard" title="Scorecard">
       <ScorecardPage />
     </EntityLayout.Route>
   );

   const serviceEntityPage = (
     <EntityLayout>
       ...
       {scorecardRoute}
     </EntityLayout>
   );

   const websiteEntityPage = (
     <EntityLayout>
       ...
       {scorecardRoute}
     </EntityLayout>
   );

   const componentPage = (
     <EntitySwitch>
       <EntitySwitch.Case if={isComponentType('service')}>
         {serviceEntityPage}
       </EntitySwitch.Case>

       <EntitySwitch.Case if={isComponentType('website')}>
         {websiteEntityPage}
       </EntitySwitch.Case>
     </EntitySwitch>
   );

   export const entityPage = (
     <EntitySwitch>
       ...
       <EntitySwitch.Case if={isKind('component')} children={componentPage} />
       ...
     </EntitySwitch>
   );
   ```

### Accessing the Plugin

1. Open your Backstage application.
2. Navigate to the Entity overview page from catalog.
