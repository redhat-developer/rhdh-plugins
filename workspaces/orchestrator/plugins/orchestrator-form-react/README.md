# backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-react

This library provides the form component used in the workflow execution form. It is decoupled from the orchestrator plugin to allow plugins implementing the OrchestratorFormApi test the behavior in a simple backstage developer environment.

Details available [here](../orchestrator/docs/extensibleForm.md).
