'@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-theme': patch
---

Align the 0.2.x theme with the latest 1.2.x RHDH theme. It's based on @redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-theme@0.1.7 and the sourcecode is migrated from https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-theme/tree/147ec09221a4440177e1bf89260c188041de7a79/src/themes/rhdh and aligned with linter and prettier rules in rhdh-plugins.
