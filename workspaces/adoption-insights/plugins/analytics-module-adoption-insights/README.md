# analytics-module-adoption-insights

Welcome to the analytics-module-adoption-insights plugin!

This plugin hooks into the backstage analytics API and emits the events to Adoption Insights backend.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/analytics-module-adoption-insights](http://localhost:3000/analytics-module-adoption-insights).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
