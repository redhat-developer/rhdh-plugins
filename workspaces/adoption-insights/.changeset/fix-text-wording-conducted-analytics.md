'@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-adoption-insights': patch
---

- Fixed confusing text in ActiveUsers and Searches components by replacing "were conducted" with professional analytics terminology
- Updated text to use "Average peak active user count" and "Average search count" for better clarity
- Enhanced time period text to properly handle all grouping types (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) instead of only supporting hour and day
