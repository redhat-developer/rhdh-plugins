# Konflux Common Plugin

This is a common library plugin that provides shared types, interfaces, and utility functions for the Konflux ecosystem. It's designed to be used by both the `konflux` frontend plugin and the `konflux-backend` backend plugin to avoid code duplication and ensure consistency.

## Contents

- Shared resource types: PipelineRun, Application, Component, Release
- Configuration parsing utilities
- Pagination constants and utilities
- Subcomponent utilities
- Shared entity processing utilities

For more information about the Konflux plugin, see the [main plugin documentation](../konflux/README.md).
