## For administrators

### Prerequisites

- Follow the lightspeed backend plugin [README](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/lightspeed/plugins/lightspeed-backend/README.md) to integrate lightspeed backend in your Backstage instance.

**Note**

### Permission Framework Support

The Lightspeed plugin has support for the permission framework.

- When [RBAC permission](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/rbac/plugins/rbac-backend#installation) framework is enabled, for non-admin users to access lightspeed UI, the role associated with your user should have the following permission policies associated with it. Add the following in your permission policies configuration file named `rbac-policy.csv`:

```CSV
p, role:default/team_a, lightspeed.chat.read, read, allow
p, role:default/team_a, lightspeed.chat.create, create, allow
p, role:default/team_a, lightspeed.chat.delete, delete, allow

g, user:default/<your-user-name>, role:default/team_a

```

You can specify the path to this configuration file in your application configuration:

```yaml
permission:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    policies-csv-file: /some/path/rbac-policy.csv
    policyFileReload: true
```

   ```console
