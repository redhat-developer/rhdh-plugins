'@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-header': patch
---

Fixes the global header starred items icon color and visibility:

- Changed star icon color to use theme.rhdh.general.starredItemsColor for better visibility and customization
- Star icon now only appears on hover instead of being always visible
- Maintains consistent styling with table view starred items across the application
