# Global header demo application

This is a scaffolded Backstage app to test the Global header plugin.

To start the app, run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

To generate knip reports for this app, run:

```sh
yarn backstage-repo-tools knip-reports
```

## Notifications plugin

To test Global Header with Notifications plugin the notitcation plugin is added and preconfigured.

You can configure your an external service as described in the [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/service-to-service-auth/#static-keys-for-plugin-to-plugin-auth) and add configuration of Notifications plugin.

For example, you can use the following configuration into an `app-config.local.yaml`:

```yaml
backend:
  auth:
    externalAccess:
      - type: static
        options:
          token: ${EXTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN}
          subject: cicd-system-completion-events
```

You can optional enable the email notification processor with a configuration like this:

```yaml
notifications:
  processors:
    email:
      transportConfig:
        transport: smtp
        hostname: smtp.gmail.com
        port: 587
        username: test@gmail.com
        password: test
      sender: test@gmail.com
      broadcastConfig:
        receiver: 'users'
```

To send notifications, you can use the following command:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:7007/api/notifications -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" -d '{"recipients":{"type":"broadcast"},"payload": {"title": "Title of boradcast message","link": "http://foo.com/bar","severity": "high","topic": "The topic"}}'
```

Replace `test-token` if you provided a custom external access token.

Then you will get real-time notifications in this dev app.

## CompanyLogo

The Global Header plugin now supports **company logos** with full control over navigation, theming, sizing, and fallback behavior.

### Key features

- Company logo is now part of the Global Header **by default**.
- Support for **theme-specific logos** (separate logos for light and dark themes).
- Support for a **single logo** used across all themes.
- **Customizable logo dimensions** via width and height props.
- **Clickable logo**: custom navigation path can be configured.
- **Backward compatibility** with older `app.branding.fullLogo` configurations.

### ⚙️ Configuration example

```yaml
# ...rest of the global header configuration
red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-global-header:
  mountPoints:
    - mountPoint: application/header
      importName: GlobalHeader
      config:
        position: above-main-content  # Options: above-sidebar | above-main-content

    - mountPoint: global.header/component
      importName: CompanyLogo
      config:
        priority: 200
        props:
          to: '/catalog'  # Path to navigate when logo is clicked
          width: 300       # Optional; fallback chain applies
          height: 200      # Optional; default max height is 40px
         #logo: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATQAAACkCAMAAAAuT...' # Single logo for all themes.
          logo:
            dark: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATQAAACkCAMAAAAuT...' # will be shown in dark theme
            light: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAgUAAABhCAMAAAB...'  # will be shown in light theme

```

### Fallback Configuration Example

In addition to the Global Header, theme-specific logo support is also available in RHDH's **sidebar logo**. This configuration is **used as a fallback** for `CompanyLogo` if props are not provided to the component. The sidebar logo and the `CompanyLogo` fallback can be configured with the following `app-config` configuration:

```yaml
app:
  branding:
    fullLogoWidth: 220 #fallback width
  # fullLogo: "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxu…" # Single image for all themes
    fullLogo:
      light: "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxu…"  # will be shown in light theme
      dark:  "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxu…"  # will be shown in dark theme
```

### Fallback Behavior

#### Logo Source Priority

1. `CompanyLogo` props (`logo` / `logo.light` / `logo.dark`)
2. `app.branding.fullLogo`
3. Default RHDH theme-specific logo

### Logo Sizing Behavior

#### Width Priority

1. `props.width` (from the dynamic plugin configuration)
2. `app.branding.fullLogoWidth` (from `app-config.yaml`)
3. Default: `150px`

#### Height Priority

Increasing the `height` also increases the overall height of the Global Header.

1. `props.height` (from configuration)
2. Default maximum height: `40px` (applied automatically if not specified)

#### Rendering Behavior

- The logo uses `object-fit: contain` to maintain the original aspect ratio.
- The image is never cropped or distorted.
- If the configured `width` would result in a height greater than the allowed maximum (default: 40px), it is **automatically scaled down**.
- This means: in some cases, changing only the width may **not visibly affect** the logo unless height is also adjusted.
