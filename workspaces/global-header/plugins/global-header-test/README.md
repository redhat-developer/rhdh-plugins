# @red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-header-test

A plugin to test `@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-header`
([GitHub](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/global-header/plugins/global-header),
[Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-global-header))

It exposes multiple test components like `TestHeader` and `TestButton`. See bundled `app-config.dynamic.yaml`.

It includes a dynamic plugin build so that we can test it directly from npm. This 'feature' might be removed as soon as we have container images for all plugins!
