# Global header

Red Hat Developer Hub includes a new configable and highly extendable global header plugin starting with RHDH 1.5.

By default it includes a Search input field, Create, Support[^1] and Notifications[^2] icon buttons and a user profile dropdown.

[^1]: Only when the Support URL is configured in the `app-config.yaml`.
[^2]: Only when the notification plugin is installed.
