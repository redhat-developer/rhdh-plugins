# Resource Optimization back-end plugin

Welcome to the redhat-resource-optimization backend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

The plugin has been added to the example app in this workspace, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` from the root directory, and then navigating to http://localhost:3000/redhat-resource-optimization.
The health check endpoint for this back-end is available at: http://localhost:7007/api/redhat-resource-optimization/health.

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start:dev` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
