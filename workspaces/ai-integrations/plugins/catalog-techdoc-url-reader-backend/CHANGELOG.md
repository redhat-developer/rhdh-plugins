## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7dc735d: a new backstage plugin, a sevice factory, is delivered to provide a URLReader that interacts with the model catalog bridges techdoc/model card endpoint; the catalog backend module is also updated so that the bridge configration information is exported and reusable by the techdoc plugin
